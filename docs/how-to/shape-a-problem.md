# How to Shape a Problem

This guide walks you through shaping a problem before proposing solutions.

## Prerequisites

- A raw idea, request, or observation
- Access to context about users and their needs

## Step 1: Capture the Raw Idea

Start with what you've heard:

> "Users want a better way to find things."
> "We need to add search."
> "The navigation is confusing."

Don't judge or refine yet. Just capture it.

## Step 2: Ask "Who"

Identify who has this problem:

- Which users?
- In what roles?
- With what goals?

**Example:**
"Power users with 500+ items who need to find specific content quickly."

## Step 3: Ask "What"

What are they trying to accomplish?

- Not: "They want search"
- But: "They want to find a specific item without browsing"

## Step 4: Ask "When"

When does this problem occur?

- What triggers it?
- How often?
- What's the context?

**Example:**
"When they're working on a project and need to reference something they created weeks ago."

## Step 5: Ask "Why Now"

Why is this important now?

- What changed?
- What's the cost of not solving it?
- What opportunity exists?

## Step 6: Understand Current Workarounds

How do users handle this today?

- Manual browsing?
- External tools?
- Asking others?
- Giving up?

Workarounds reveal the true need.

## Step 7: Define the Job-to-be-Done

Frame the problem as a JTBD:

> When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].

**Example:**
> When I'm working on a project and need to reference old content, I want to find it quickly, so I can continue my work without interruption.

## Step 8: Set Boundaries

A shaped problem is **bounded**:

### In Scope

What's definitely part of this problem?

### Out of Scope

What related problems are we NOT solving?

### Appetite Hint

How much time might this be worth?

## Step 9: Document the Problem Statement

Create a problem document with:

```markdown
# Problem: [Title]

## Raw Idea
[Original request]

## Context
- Who: [Users]
- What: [Goal]
- When: [Trigger]
- Why Now: [Urgency]
- Workarounds: [Current solutions]

## Job-to-be-Done
When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome].

## Boundaries
- In Scope: [What's included]
- Out of Scope: [What's excluded]
- Appetite Suggestion: [Time budget guess]

## Next Steps
- [ ] Shape solution
- [ ] Create breadboard
- [ ] Write pitch
```

## Common Mistakes

### Jumping to Solutions

**Wrong:** "We need search."
**Right:** "Users can't find content in large projects."

### Being Too Vague

**Wrong:** "Navigation is confusing."
**Right:** "Users with 10+ projects can't find the one they need."

### Including Everything

**Wrong:** "Solve all findability issues."
**Right:** "Help users find specific items by name or content."

## Example: Complete Problem

```markdown
# Problem: Finding Content in Large Projects

## Raw Idea
"Power users say they can't find anything."

## Context
- Who: Users with 500+ items
- What: Find specific items without browsing
- When: Working on projects, need references
- Why Now: Top support complaint, user churn risk
- Workarounds: Manual browsing, external notes, giving up

## Job-to-be-Done
When I'm working and need to reference old content, I want to
find it by typing what I remember, so I can continue without
breaking my flow.

## Boundaries
- In Scope: Finding items by name, finding items by content
- Out of Scope: Cross-project search, advanced filters, analytics
- Appetite Suggestion: Small Batch (2 weeks)

## Next Steps
- [x] Shape problem
- [ ] Shape solution
- [ ] Create breadboard
- [ ] Write pitch
```

## Next Steps

After shaping the problem:

1. **Shape Solution (SS)** - Explore and refine the approach
2. **Breadboard (BB)** - Map the technical flow
3. **Write Pitch (WP)** - Create the formal pitch

The problem is the foundation. Shape it well.
