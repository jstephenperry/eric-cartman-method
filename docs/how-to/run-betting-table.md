# How to Run a Betting Table

This guide walks you through running a betting table session.

## Prerequisites

- Shaped pitches ready for betting
- Decision-makers available
- Understanding of cycle capacity

## What is a Betting Table?

The betting table is where strategic commitments are made:

- Review shaped pitches
- Make bet/no-bet decisions
- Assign pitches to cycles
- Respect capacity limits

## Before the Meeting

### Gather Pitches

Collect all pitches with status "Ready for Betting."

### Review Capacity

Know what capacity is available:
- How many builders?
- Big batch or small batch cycle?
- Any constraints?

### Pre-read

Share pitches with attendees before the meeting.

## During the Meeting

### Step 1: Set Context

"We have [N] pitches to review for [cycle type].
Our capacity is [X builders].
Let's make betting decisions."

### Step 2: Review Each Pitch

For each pitch, cover:

1. **Problem** (2 minutes)
   - What's the job-to-be-done?
   - Why now?

2. **Appetite** (1 minute)
   - Small Batch or Big Batch?
   - What's being cut to fit?

3. **Solution** (3 minutes)
   - Key approach
   - Breadboard (if applicable)

4. **Risks** (2 minutes)
   - Rabbit holes identified
   - De-risking done

5. **No-gos** (1 minute)
   - What's explicitly out?

### Step 3: Discuss

Questions to consider:

- Is this shaped enough to bet on?
- Does appetite match importance?
- Do we have the right people?
- What's the opportunity cost?

### Step 4: Decide

For each pitch, decide:

| Decision | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **BET** | Commit to this cycle |
| **NO BET** | Not right now |
| **RESHAPE** | Needs more shaping |

### Step 5: Assign

For bets:
- Which cycle?
- Which builders?
- Any special notes?

### Step 6: Document

Record all decisions:

```markdown
# Betting Table: [Date]

## Bets Made

| Pitch | Appetite | Cycle | Team |
|-------|----------|-------|------|
| [Pitch 1] | Small Batch | Cycle 5 | Alex |
| [Pitch 2] | Big Batch | Cycle 5 | Alex, Jordan |

## Not Bet

| Pitch | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| [Pitch 3] | Lower priority than bets above |

## Sent for Reshaping

| Pitch | Feedback |
|-------|----------|
| [Pitch 4] | Rabbit holes not addressed |
```

## Decision Framework

### Bet If

- Problem is clear and valuable
- Solution is shaped (rough, solved, bounded)
- Appetite fits importance
- Rabbit holes are addressed
- Capacity is available

### No Bet If

- Lower priority than other pitches
- Timing isn't right
- Capacity is full
- Not urgent enough

### Reshape If

- Problem isn't clear
- Solution is too vague
- Rabbit holes remain
- Appetite doesn't fit

## Facilitation Tips

### Keep it Moving

- Time-box pitch presentations
- Cut off tangents
- Make decisions, don't defer

### Focus on Trade-offs

- "If we bet on X, we can't bet on Y"
- "What's more important right now?"

### Respect Capacity

- Don't over-commit
- Leave room for uncertainty
- Small batch bets use capacity too

### Be Decisive

- "Bet" or "No bet" - not "Maybe"
- "No bet" is a valid decision
- Don't carry items forward

## After the Meeting

### Communicate Decisions

Share betting outcomes with:
- Pitch authors
- Assigned builders
- Broader team

### Update Pitch Status

- Bet pitches: "Bet for [Cycle]"
- No bet: "Not Bet - [Date]"
- Reshape: "Needs Reshaping"

### Prepare for Cycle

For bet pitches:
- Schedule cycle planning
- Brief assigned team
- Ensure resources ready

## Common Mistakes

### Betting Without Shaping

**Wrong:** Betting on raw ideas.
**Right:** Only bet on shaped pitches.

### Avoiding "No Bet"

**Wrong:** "Let's think about it more."
**Right:** "No bet for this cycle."

### Over-committing

**Wrong:** Betting on more than fits.
**Right:** Respect capacity limits.

### Endless Discussion

**Wrong:** Debating for 30 minutes.
**Right:** Time-box, decide, move on.

## Cadence

Run betting tables:
- Once per cycle (before cycle starts)
- Duration: 1-2 hours
- Attendees: Decision-makers + pitch authors

## Summary

The betting table:
1. Reviews shaped pitches
2. Makes explicit decisions
3. Assigns to cycles
4. Respects capacity

No backlogs. No maybes. Just bets.
