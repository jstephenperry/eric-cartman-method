# The Circuit Breaker

The circuit breaker is the moment of truth at the end of every cycle. Ship or kill. No other options.

## What is a Circuit Breaker?

In electrical engineering, a circuit breaker stops current flow to prevent damage.

In Shape Up, the circuit breaker stops the cycle:
- On the deadline date
- No exceptions
- No extensions
- Ship what's done, or kill the bet

## Why Circuit Breakers?

### They Prevent Death Marches

Without a circuit breaker:
"We're almost done. Just one more week."
"OK, one more week."
"We're still almost done..."

With a circuit breaker:
The deadline is real. Cut scope or ship what's ready.

### They Force Honest Progress

Teams can't hide behind "we're 90% done."
At circuit breaker, either you can ship or you can't.

### They Protect Future Cycles

Work that doesn't ship doesn't spill into the next cycle.
The next cycle starts fresh, not burdened by "just finishing up."

### They Enable Variable Scope

Since time is fixed, scope must flex.
Circuit breakers are what make fixed time real.

## The Two Decisions

At circuit breaker, only two options exist:

### SHIP

Deploy what's complete. Cut what isn't.

- Does the shipped work deliver value?
- Is it better than nothing?
- Are users better off with this partial solution?

If yes → SHIP

### KILL

Cancel the bet entirely. Learn and move on.

- Is the core problem still worth solving?
- Was the approach fundamentally wrong?
- Would shipping harm users?

If shipping would be worse than nothing → KILL

## What's Not Allowed

### Extensions

"Just one more week."
NO. If you need more time, you bet wrong.

### Carry-over

"We'll finish this next cycle."
NO. Next cycle has its own bets.

### Partial Promises

"We'll ship part now and part later."
NO. Ship what's shippable now. Future work needs new betting.

### Scope Creep at Deadline

"While we're here, let's also..."
NO. Cut, don't add.

## How to Prepare

### Throughout the Cycle

- Update hill charts honestly
- Cut nice-to-haves early
- Flag stuck scopes immediately
- Don't hide problems

### A Week Before

Review:
- What's definitely shippable?
- What needs to be cut?
- Any blockers that need escalation?

### Day Before

Finalize:
- What we're shipping
- What we're cutting
- Any last-minute decisions

## Making the Decision

### Evaluate Each Scope

| Scope | Shippable? | Value Alone? | Decision |
|-------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Login | Yes | Yes | Ship |
| Password reset | No | N/A | Cut |
| Profile | Yes | Limited | Ship |

### Consider the Whole

Does shipping the shippable scopes:
- Deliver the core job-to-be-done?
- Provide value to users?
- Move the product forward?

If yes → SHIP (even without some scopes)
If no → KILL (learn and try differently)

## After the Decision

### If SHIP

1. Deploy the shipped scopes
2. Communicate what shipped (and what didn't)
3. Archive cut scope documentation
4. Update pitch status
5. Celebrate shipping

### If KILL

1. Archive all cycle work
2. Document what we learned
3. Communicate the decision
4. Consider if problem needs reshaping
5. Move on without guilt

## Learning from Circuit Breakers

Every circuit breaker teaches something:

### If We Shipped

- What made scopes shippable?
- What got cut and why?
- Was appetite right?
- How did shaping help?

### If We Killed

- Why didn't it work?
- Was shaping incomplete?
- Was appetite wrong?
- Were rabbit holes missed?

## Common Mistakes

### Avoiding the Decision

"Let's discuss this tomorrow."
NO. The decision must be made on the deadline.

### Creating New Categories

"It's not shipped or killed, it's 'paused'."
NO. There are only two categories.

### Guilt About Killing

Killed bets aren't failures. They're experiments that provided information.

### Scope Heroics

"I'll just work the weekend to finish."
NO. If scope needed cutting, cut it.

## Summary

The circuit breaker is:
- A fixed deadline
- A binary decision
- A protection for future work
- A forcing function for honesty

At cycle end:
- **SHIP** what's done
- **KILL** if shipping would harm

No extensions. No carry-over. No exceptions.

Fixed time, variable scope - enforced.
