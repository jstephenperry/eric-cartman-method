# Betting vs Backlog

Shape Up replaces the backlog with a betting table. This document explains why.

## The Backlog Problem

Backlogs seem helpful but create real problems:

### They Grow Forever

Every feature request, bug report, and "we should" becomes an item.
The backlog becomes a graveyard of half-formed ideas.

### They Require Constant Grooming

Someone must regularly:
- Prioritize items
- Remove stale items
- Re-estimate
- Merge duplicates
- Fight about order

This work produces little value.

### They Create False Promises

Items in a backlog feel like commitments.
"It's in the backlog" sounds like "we'll do it."
Users expect backlog items to ship.

### They Mix Everything Together

Raw ideas next to shaped work.
Big features next to tiny fixes.
Urgent mixed with important.

### They Enable Avoidance

"Add it to the backlog" means "I don't want to decide right now."
The backlog becomes a way to defer without saying no.

## The Betting Alternative

Shape Up uses a betting table instead:

### Only Shaped Work

Raw ideas don't reach the table.
Work must be shaped: rough, solved, bounded.

### Explicit Decisions

Every pitch gets a clear answer:
- **BET:** We're doing this
- **NO BET:** Not this cycle (not "later")
- **RESHAPE:** Needs more work

### No Commitments Beyond the Cycle

A bet is for one cycle.
We don't promise "someday."

### Limited Capacity

The betting table respects cycle capacity.
You can't bet on more work than fits.

### Fresh Evaluation

Each betting table evaluates pitches on current merit.
"We said we'd do this" isn't a reason.

## Important Ideas Resurface

"But what about tracking ideas?"

Shape Up's answer: Important ideas come back.

### If It Matters

- Someone will bring it up again
- Users will ask about it again
- The problem will remain visible
- A new pitch will be written

### If It Doesn't

- Nobody mentions it
- Users don't ask
- The problem fades
- We saved time not tracking it

This is the "no backlog" principle.

## Handling Ideas

When new ideas come in:

### Quick Assessment

Ask:
1. Does this need shaping? (Yes → shape later, No → quick flow)
2. Is this urgent? (Yes → shape now, No → note and move on)
3. Who cares about this? (Nobody → let it go)

### If It Needs Shaping

Don't add to a list. Either:
- Shape it now (if important)
- Trust it to resurface (if not)

### If It's Small

Use Quick Flow:
- Quick Spec (QS)
- Quick Dev (QD)

Small work doesn't need betting.

## The Betting Table

### Who Attends

- People who can make commitments
- People who understand capacity
- People who've seen the pitches

### What Happens

1. Review each pitch
2. Discuss trade-offs
3. Make bet/no-bet decisions
4. Assign to cycles
5. Done

### Frequency

Once per cycle, before the next cycle starts.

## Comparison

| Backlog | Betting Table |
|---------|---------------|
| Endless list | Shaped pitches only |
| "Add it" | "Bet or no bet" |
| Prioritize weekly | Decide per cycle |
| Implicit promises | Explicit decisions |
| Grows forever | Clears each cycle |
| Grooming required | No grooming |
| Everything tracked | Important resurfaces |

## Common Concerns

### "We'll Lose Track of Ideas"

No. Important ideas don't get lost. They get reshaped and re-pitched.

### "What About Customer Promises?"

Don't promise backlog items. Promise outcomes. Deliver what fits appetite.

### "How Do We Plan Roadmaps?"

Roadmaps show direction, not commitments. Betting happens each cycle.

### "Our Team Likes the Backlog"

Many teams confuse comfort with effectiveness. Try betting for 2-3 cycles.

## Summary

The backlog is a crutch that:
- Grows forever
- Requires grooming
- Creates false promises
- Enables avoidance

Betting is a discipline that:
- Forces explicit decisions
- Respects capacity
- Makes no promises beyond the cycle
- Trusts important ideas to resurface

Let go of the backlog. Embrace the bet.
