# Exploration Workflow

## Overview

Exploration is blue-sky time to prototype ideas that might become future pitches. No commitment, no pressure - just curiosity.

**Purpose:** Generate raw ideas and early validations that feed into future shaping.

## What is Exploration?

Exploration is:
- **Curiosity-driven** - "What if we..."
- **Time-boxed** - Short experiments
- **Low-pressure** - No commitment to ship
- **Idea-generating** - Feeds future shaping

Exploration is NOT:
- Full feature development
- Shaping (that's separate)
- Commitments to ship
- "Sneaking in" features

## Step 1: Choose an Exploration Topic

Welcome {{user_name}}! Let's explore some ideas.

**Sources of exploration topics:**
- Ideas that came up during cycles
- User feedback patterns
- Technology curiosity
- Competitor observations
- "Wouldn't it be cool if..."

### Exploration Ideas

| Idea | Source | Curiosity Level |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| {{idea_1}} | {{source_1}} | High/Med/Low |
| {{idea_2}} | {{source_2}} | High/Med/Low |

**Selected for exploration:**
{{selected_idea}}

## Step 2: Define the Experiment

### What are we trying to learn?

**Question:** {{exploration_question}}

### What would success look like?

**Success criteria:**
- {{success_1}}
- {{success_2}}

### What's the minimum experiment?

**Prototype approach:**
{{prototype_approach}}

### Time box

**Maximum time:** {{time_box}} (recommend 1-2 days max)

## Step 3: Run the Experiment

### Experiment Log

| Time | Activity | Finding |
|------|----------|---------|
| {{time_1}} | {{activity_1}} | {{finding_1}} |
| {{time_2}} | {{activity_2}} | {{finding_2}} |

### Key Observations

- {{observation_1}}
- {{observation_2}}
- {{observation_3}}

## Step 4: Document Findings

Create exploration notes:

`{shaping_artifacts}/exploration/exploration-{{topic_slug}}-{{date}}.md`

```markdown
# Exploration: {{topic}}

**Date:** {{date}}
**Explorer:** {{explorer}}
**Time Spent:** {{time_spent}}

## Question

{{exploration_question}}

## Approach

{{prototype_approach}}

## Findings

### What We Learned
{{learnings}}

### What Worked
{{what_worked}}

### What Didn't Work
{{what_didnt}}

### Surprises
{{surprises}}

## Artifacts

**Prototype location:** {{prototype_location}}
**Screenshots/recordings:** {{artifacts}}

## Recommendation

{{recommendation}}

### Should this become a pitch?
- [ ] Yes - worth shaping
- [ ] Maybe - needs more exploration
- [ ] No - not worth pursuing

### If yes, initial appetite guess:
{{appetite_guess}}

### Key considerations for shaping:
{{shaping_considerations}}
```

## Step 5: Share (Optional)

If the exploration is interesting:

1. **Demo** - Show what you found
2. **Discuss** - Get reactions
3. **Note interest** - Gauge appetite
4. **File for shaping** - If there's interest

## Exploration Principles

1. **Curiosity first** - Follow what's interesting
2. **Time-boxed** - Don't go down rabbit holes
3. **No commitment** - Exploration ≠ feature
4. **Document findings** - Future you will thank you
5. **Share selectively** - Not every exploration is gold

## What Happens Next?

After exploration:

- **Interesting + urgent:** Start shaping (SP workflow)
- **Interesting + not urgent:** File for later
- **Not interesting:** Archive and move on
- **Needs more exploration:** Schedule for next cool-down

## Completion

Exploration complete. Findings documented.

If this should become a pitch, next steps:
1. Shape Problem (SP)
2. Write Pitch (WP)
3. Present at Betting Table (BT)

Remember: Most explorations won't become pitches, and that's okay.
