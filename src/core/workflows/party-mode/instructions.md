# Party Mode - Multi-Agent Collaboration

## Overview

Party Mode enables multiple ECM agents to collaborate on complex tasks that benefit from diverse perspectives. This is especially useful for:

- Shaping complex problems (Shaper + Technical Shaper)
- Reviewing pitches before betting (Pitcher + Cycle Lead)
- Evaluating technical approaches (Technical Shaper + Builder)
- Circuit breaker decisions (Cycle Lead + Builder)

## How It Works

1. **Identify the task** that needs multi-agent collaboration
2. **Select agents** based on the task requirements
3. **Facilitate discussion** between agents
4. **Synthesize output** into actionable decisions

## Agent Combinations

### Shaping Session
- **Maya (Shaper)** + **Wyatt (Technical Shaper)**
- For: Complex problems needing both business and technical shaping

### Pitch Review
- **Parker (Pitcher)** + **Cameron (Cycle Lead)**
- For: Validating pitches before betting table

### Technical De-risking
- **Wyatt (Technical Shaper)** + **Alex (Builder)**
- For: Deep technical analysis and rabbit hole identification

### Circuit Breaker Review
- **Cameron (Cycle Lead)** + **Alex (Builder)**
- For: Ship vs kill decisions at cycle end

## Facilitation Guidelines

1. Each agent speaks from their perspective
2. Focus on shipping, not perfection
3. Cut scope to meet deadlines
4. No extensions, no exceptions
5. Document decisions for future reference

## Output

Party Mode sessions produce:
- Decision summary
- Action items with owners
- Updated artifacts (pitches, scopes, hill charts)
